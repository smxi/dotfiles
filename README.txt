Dotfiles and configurations.

These will be updated now and then since getting kate/geany colors
reasonably clear is an ongoing process.

Kate:
kateschema: use inport feature to import into kate code editor. 
vim-dark-custom.kateschema is a modified and more readable version of the
vim (dark) schema.

i3:
i3/config: save as config to either ~/.config/i3/config or /etc/i3/config
Requires i3bar and i3status. Very minimal, just the basics, for a clean simple
i3 setup. Adjust to suite your taste, paths, and features.

Geany: 
Copy geany/vibrant-ink-2.conf  to $HOME/.config/geany/colorchemes
Copy geany/filedefs.perl to $HOME/.config/geany/filedefs
