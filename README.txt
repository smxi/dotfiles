Dotfiles and configurations.

These will be updated now and then since getting kate/geany colors
reasonably clear is an ongoing process.

Note that code editor colorschemes will focus on PHP and Perl.

Kate:
kateschema: use inport feature to import into kate code editor. 
* dark-1 is the working dark scheme. 
Global colors. Languages adjusted: Perl, Bash, PHP.
 
This will be updated routinely as it's adapted to be more usable 
than most of the default dark schemes.

* vim-dark-custom.kateschema is a modified and more readable version 
of the vim (dark) schema. Note that it is not done, unfortunately.

i3:
i3/config: save as config to either ~/.config/i3/config or /etc/i3/config
Requires i3bar and i3status. Very minimal, just the basics, for a clean 
simple i3 setup. Adjust to suite your taste, paths, and features.

Geany: 
Copy geany/vibrant-ink-2.conf  to $HOME/.config/geany/colorchemes
Copy geany/filedefs.perl to $HOME/.config/geany/filedefs
